I am a passionate about challenges, competition and learning. I have wide experience in Nanoelectronics, System-on-Chip design and Digital Systems Design/Verification. Enclosed is my resume which more fully details my background and work experience, and how they relate to your position. I am currently in the second year of the EMECS program (European Masters in Embedded Computing Systems) undertaking studies in the Kaiserslautern Technical University (Germany), previous year I was studying in Southampton University (ECS).

\lettersection{Why ARM?}
I spent the summer of 2018 doing an Internship with ARM. I was positively implressed with the environment, people who work there, my relationships with the manager and other team members. Surely I was introduced to Graduate Positions at ARM and to the majority of departments which have them. One of them which stands out to me was Central Engineering. I know how much ARM does in the industry, how much influence it has and the variety of products that ARM developed. All these attract me to this particular opportunity with ARM.

\lettersection{Why Me?}
I already have an experience of working with ARM. I finished my first year at the University of Southampton with First Class marks (average 84\%) which shows the level of my interest and abilities in this industry. I firmly believe that I can be a valuable asset to your team. I welcome the opportunity to speak with you about this position and how my experience hopefully be of value to ARM.
